Programming Exercise One: Variables and Functions

This is a computer program which performs some
simple calculations and prints the results to
screen.

As program input has not been covered in class,
the values are hard-coded into the program, as
per the assignment requirements.

Problem 1:- Volume of a Sphere
	Calculates the volume of a sphere, using
	the equation:
		'V = 4/3 * pi * radius^3'

Problem 2:- Smallest Money
	Converts a monetary value (specified in
	pounds) into its largest note and coin
	constituents.

Problem 3:- Adding Times
	Two times are added together:
		
		1) The initial time, specified in
	24 hour clock format.

		2) A time duration, specified in
	a similar way (ie 345 = 3 hours, 45 mins)
