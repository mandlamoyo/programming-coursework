Programming Coursework 2: Simple RSS Parser

This program implements a computer program which
reads an RSS document, looks for specific elements,
and prints out only certain information (in this
case, the title of the articles) to the screen. Two
BBC News RSS documents are included for use as
examples.

As specified by the assignment brief, RSS documents
must be fed into the program using the redirect
operator on the command line.

e.g. '$ ./readrss < rssfile.xml'
